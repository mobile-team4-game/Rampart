Setup/Installation Procedures:
1) Create a github.com account
2) Email me your user name, I will add you to the team
3) The installation is a multi-step process. You will need
   both git for your machine and the egit plugin for eclipse.
4) Install git. I have tested both Mac and Windows 
   installation instructions, and both work.
   * Windows: http://help.github.com/win-git-installation/
   * Mac: http://help.github.com/mac-git-installation/
   * Linux: http://help.github.com/linux-git-installation/
5) Generate SSH keys.
   * Windows: http://help.github.com/msysgit-key-setup/
   * Mac: http://help.github.com/mac-key-setup/
   * Linux: http://help.github.com/linux-key-setup/
6) Set git configuration.
   * http://help.github.com/git-email-settings/
7) Download egit plugin. Note - If you want to use
   git from the command line and feel comfortable
   memorizing the commands, go for it.
   * Open eclipse.
   * Help > Install New Software...
   * Work with: "--All Available Sites--"
   * Collaboration > Eclipse EGit (Incubation)
   * Follow the steps, accept the license, etc...
8) You should be ready to go from here. I found a great
   website for basic operation of git, including working
   with github. 
   * http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#

At this point, you should have access to our team's
github, if you don't email me asap.

From here, the basic process will be as follows:
1) Clone the project repo.
   * The uri can be found on the team github page
     If you have git/egit installed properly it 
     should be able to clone without any problems.
     On windows, I kept getting an "Auth Failed"
     error. To correct this, inside eclipse:
     * Preferences > General > Network Connections >
       SSH2
     * SSH2 Home should be "something\.ssh", wherever
       you generated your keys to.
2) Make updates and add files/folders/resources.
   * Right click new elements and "Team->Add" them
     to the repo.
3) Commit changes to your local repo.
   * Right click project folder and "Team->Commit"
4) Push changes to remote repo.
   * Right click project folder and "Team->Push"
5) Fetch updates from remote to local.
   * Right click project folder and "Team->Fetch from..."
6) Merge local repo and the project folder eclipse sees.
   * Right click project folder and "Team->Merge"
7) Create your own branches to modify code on without changing
   the main/master branch.
   * Right click project folder and "Team->Branch"
   * Select the branch you want to create from and 
     give a new name, a new branch is created.
   * Checkout will allow you to work on a specific branch.
8) Reset your local repo to the remote repo
   * Right click proejct folder and "Team->Reset"
   
Testing git/github:
Clone the github repo, and create your test branch.
Check out your test branch. Modify this README by adding your
name and email under authors, and pushing the modified 
file and your new test branch back.

General Source Control Procedure:
You will only clone once. Create a personal test branch
"test_<lastname>". Make sure to "Check out" your personal 
branch. Make updates, etc... Add the updates. Commit the updates.
Push your test branch to the remote repo. When you have your 
remote branch tested and working properly, on github > Request Pull.
Your changes will be reviewed by the team, then I will merge them into
the main branch. **Do not merge your own code into the main branch.**
This is only a requirement because once we start coding, people are likely
to break things a lot constantly merging with the main branch. So, request
a pull and we can make sure every one has the latest, working versions.
